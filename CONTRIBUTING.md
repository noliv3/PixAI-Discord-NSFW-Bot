# Contributing

Thank you for considering contributing to this project. Bugs, feature requests, and pull requests are welcome!

## Reporting Issues

If you find a bug or have an idea for a feature, please open an issue on GitHub. Provide a clear description and, if applicable, steps to reproduce the problem.

## Making Changes

1. Fork this repository and clone your fork locally.
2. Create a new branch for your change:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b my-feature
   ```
3. Make your modifications and ensure the project still works.
4. Commit your changes with a concise message describing the update.
5. Push your branch and open a pull request against `main`.

## Coding Style

- Use **4 spaces** for indentation.
- Prefer `const` and `let` over `var`.
- Terminate statements with semicolons.
- Use `camelCase` for variables and functions.
- Keep functions small and focused.

## Commit Guidelines

- Write short, present-tense summaries (e.g. "Add new event command").
- Reference related issues in the body of the commit message when relevant.

## Branching Model

Create feature branches from `main` and open pull requests when ready. Avoid force pushes on shared branches.
